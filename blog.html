        <p class="quote">Would you be interested in pursuing a career in the field of information technology?
        Do you know how to put the power and magic of coding into actions?

        <p>Building an application using common programming languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript is an essential
        21st-century skill. Virtually every industry, from design to journalism to marketing, now requires professionals to work
        closely with technical teams. The skills you learn in our courses or workshops will allow you to make edits and updates to
        your application (like websites or mobile Apps) and communicate more effectively with technical stakeholders, giving you
        a competitive advantage.</p>
    
    
    
        <p>Our practical courses and workshops are designed to teach students how to translate their ideas into functional, stylized
        applications for personal or business purposes. You will learn how to design and build an application that leverages the
        principles of user-centric design and will master the technical vocabulary required to communicate your ideas to others.
